Schedule University - an ecosystem of services for universitet schedule management. 

## 📖 About the project
**Schedule University** is a digital ecosystem aimed at uniting Russian universities (_schedules, homework, other activities_) in one unified shell with convenient and timely access, notifications, and timely updates.  

## 👨‍💻 Problems to be solved
For us, as former students, the problem of scheduling has always been acute, as most of the Russian universities do not have the necessary resources to create and maintain their own scheduling services. 

We decided to fix this with our project: Schedule University, designed to fix this problem by providing a convenient link between university and students in the form of a vast ecosystem of schedule services.

## 🛤 Development
We are planning a broad development of our ecosystem and the roadmap already includes adding new universities, creating bots to easily track changes, integrating with popular calendar apps and much, much more.
